## 🚨 Risk Management

### **Identified Risks & Mitigations**
```yaml
Risk: Payment integration delays
Mitigation: Start integration in Sprint 1, have backup payment provider

Risk: Design and development by same person may slow progress
Mitigation: Quick mockups first, iterate on implementation, use existing UI libraries

Risk: Azure setup complexity
Mitigation: Use managed services, start with basic tier

Risk: Multi-language complexity
Mitigation: Start with Korean only for MVP, add others progressively

Risk: Team member absence
Mitigation: Knowledge sharing, documentation, pair programming
```

## 📝 Communication Channels

```yaml
Daily Standup: Slack #standup channel
Code Review: GitHub Pull Requests
Design Review: Figma comments
Urgent Issues: Discord voice channel
Documentation: Notion/Confluence
Task Tracking: Jira/GitHub Projects
```

## 🎉 Post-Launch Plan (November)

1. **Week 1**: Monitor and stabilize
2. **Week 2**: Gather user feedback
3. **Week 3**: Plan Phase 2 features
4. **Week 4**: Begin multi-tenant implementation
